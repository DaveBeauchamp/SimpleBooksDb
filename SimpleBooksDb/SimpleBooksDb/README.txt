Most of this should be straight forward so finish it off tomorrow.
started on the methods for the buttons. the nav buttons will need 
thinking as it's been a while tohugh should come fast. use SQL for this
as it will be easy to implement everywhere though write and comment
a list version. list version may not be useful in a stateless environment
so don't get to caught up in it. Yes this is a forms app and stateless
is not the case though make sure that you keep a good dev pattern.

Do the buttons
Do the comboBox
Do the DGV 
Polish and done (by polish I mean the create database part so it is more 
graceful. try put a transaction in to rollback on failure).
